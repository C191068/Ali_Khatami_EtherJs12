### Alchemy dashboard and the Mempool 

Alchemy can teach us and show us a lot about transaction <br>

also teach us baout things that are going behind the scene <br>

including a concept called mempool <br>

Alchemy have ton of tools to provide window visibility into what's <br>
going on so that users can actually debug <br>
if there is nay usage error <br>
